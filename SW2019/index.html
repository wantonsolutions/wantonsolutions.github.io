<h1 id="reading_lambda.pngreadinglambdauniversityofchicagoprogramminglanguagesreadinggroup"><img src="writing.jpg" alt="" title="Writing Image" /> UCSD CSE Effective Writing Group: Summer 2019</h1>

<p>Writing clearly and effectively is difficult for most people, computer scientists are no exception. The purpose of this group is to collectively critique our own academic writing. Our cause is to improve communication in science for the benefit of all! </p>

<h2 id="format">Format</h2>
<p> 

Each week all members of the group will read a chapter of <a
    href="https://www.amazon.com/Style-Lessons-Clarity-Grace-11th/dp/0321898680">Style
    Lessons in Clarity and Grace</a>. One member of the group will submit a
recent piece of their own writing for critique. All other members then apply
the style rules from the weeks readings and suggest improvements. The goal is
to improve our own writing style so submitted works should be written without
the aid or correction of advisers.
