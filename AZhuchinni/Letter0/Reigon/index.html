California is composed of a variety of beautiful and hazardous biomes. The West
Coast from San Diego and Los Angeles is part of a special and rare biome known
as the chaparral. It’s a dry and dusty climate with occasional intense humidity
blown in from the ocean which makes a thick fog on most fall mornings. Every
hillside is covered in shrubs, cacti and non-native palm trees (all of which
were planted by missionaries). I crashed my bike while enjoying a ride in the
fog and among the trees, I was thrown over the handlebars and skidded along the
pavement in slick sandals until I hit an embankment and went tumbling into a
shrub. This was my most intimate engagement with the chaparral to date (my bike
remains unfixed [photo of bike]). San Diego is the most diverse biome in the
United States, in addition to the Chaparral it is composed of the Pacific
Ocean, San Diego river basin, and multiple desserts.

In one of my long Facebook posts I mentioned the Anza-Borrego dessert. It’s a harsh
place but full of harsh life. I went there to witness the Superbloom, an
intense botanical explosion in the desert. I wore my Neo Yokio Caprese Martini
shirt on the trip, it did not protect my shins from the promiscuous cacti. I
reenacted the scene from No Country for Old Men with Anton Sugar in the bathroom
performing self surgery on my car ride home. It was worth it. If you find
yourself out in the California's you would be remiss to not visit the desert.

Many of my exploits over the past year involve rock climbing, and the people I
went with. Joshua Tree is a magical rock garden hidden out at altitude in the
desert. Sand swept granite rises out of the desert, twisting and swooping into
all kinds of strange and unique shapes. The contours and cracks on the hard,
gritty granite makes it a climbers paradise. I went with three lab mates Erin
McGinnis, Audrey Randall, and Rajdeep Das, each a character in their own right.
Together we struggled up the notoriously difficult J-Tree boulders. I shredded
myself on classic dubbed “Pig Fucker”, a flaking and powerful mantel onto an
overhanging crack. For my success Audrey made me a figurine [picture of pig].
Yabo roof nearly dislocated my shoulder. We all got blown raw by granite in the
wind, Raj dropped Erin on her ass with no pad, and Erin kicked me in the head
twice on the car ride home.

The day before Joshua Tree I climbed in New Jack City, a dusty crag in the
desert filled with snakes and beatniks. I climbed sketchy routes which tested
my will on the slick granite. Erin nearly died disconnecting her rope from the
belay loops while setting an anchor. Raj almost pulled me to serious injury by
not knowing his gear, and Audry climbed the hardest route out of all of us and
nearly degloved her finger by pulling on a bolt. The rock features of New Jack
are jagged and slick granite. These features are typified by the areas premiere
route Crooked Dick which was too busy to climb. Two climbing bums in their late
40’s Bill, and Ted cheered our team on while drinking beers at 9am and talking
about the good old days. Bill picked up a 10 pound gopher snake and attempted
to make every man woman and child touch the friendly beast before putting it
back on the ground. Our crew was joined by two more UCSD students Daniel (a
stern outdoorsman), and MJ ( a hilarious homosexual). Together the 6 of us did
acro yoga and only sustained minor injuries. I managed to base Erin for a side
star tick tock without killing her, an achievement for my usually taut
hamstrings. MJ dropped me on my face while I was trying to fly.</p>

Mt. San Jacinto State Park is accessible via the united states highest rotating
tram. The tram rises out of Palm Springs over near vertical precipice while
spinning and blasting hits from the 50’s to the 90's including "staying alive"
and "I believe in a thing called love". Mt. San Jacinto (Tramway) is the cool,
due to altitude, summer rock climbing roost for Southern California. The park
was filled with critters, chipmunks, squirrels, coyotes, and unseen bears. My
team was Tammy (a heart surgeon), Erin (a colleague), and Ken (a lovable
pervert). Ken, the most experienced climber, guided us through tramway park
exposing us to some of it’s best climbing. A personable man, Ken chatted with
every group we met,  he suggested subtle and useful beta, bummed a beer, asked
to swap shoes with people, and insisted for five minutes that it was a
gentleman's duty to carry tampons in the wilderness to a group of seven women
we bumped into. Ken also caught my head during a fall. I still climb with this
enigma of the man to this day. Tramway in the evening is a beautiful place,
Riding the tram, and slowly descending into the sweltering desert from the
mountain tops and watching the sun disappear over the crest of the valley is
stunning. On the three hour drive home Tammy gave me the best directions I’ve
ever been given through this strange desert land.
