<h2 id="recreation">Recreation</h2>

<p>
The life of a PhD student is mainly study, but the high enery healthy people
that the masochistic job attracts leads to adventours activities. My lab mates
with adventure in their bones incude Audry, Raj, Erin, MJ, and Anil. Allrisk
members of this list I convinced to haul their asses up rock walls, and in turn
got me to commit to fun and strange activities in turn. My rock climbing
adventures are the most numerous, and too wide to recount all in a letter
without becoming boring. However I will recount some of my adventures and the
people I've done them with.
</p>

<p>
Multi-pitch climing is when you climb more than one pitch, a pitch is 30-45m,
when you complete the first your belay partner follows up the leader and you
continue climbing. This is how you climb sheer mountian faces thousands of feet
high. Before comming to San Diego I had never multi pitch climbed before. My
lab mate Audrey Randel, a red headed distance runner with a hair trigger
personality and scary cutting marks on her forearm, suggested that we go climb
Mt El Cajon after learning that I was a strong climber. Audrey pulled up to my
house 5:00am that Sunday morning with red Subaru. On the way to the route I got
chewed out for not waiting outside and asking what Reddit was. After a 30min
drive and 45min uphill hike to the base of the craig I realized I could not
find my belay device, a critical piece of climbing gear, which as it happens
had fallen from my bag. We decided not to do the route as rational humans,
tried a few single pitches, devised a way to pass our single belay devince back
and fourth by swining it up to 40m between us on a rope and headed up. For the
next 3 hours my life was at extreme risk as neither of us knew exactly what to
do, and our single most critical piece of saftly gear was quite often haning
from a literal thread. The feeling of fear climaxed when I nearly to a 80ft
fall off an outcropping known as triton tower at 400ft. We ascended the
mountian, and passing our belay device back and fourth lowered eachother down
the mountain. I cried a little when my feet touched the ground. Audrey lectured
me on why Prince Andrew and Pierre were both bastards and we ate some icecream
afterwards. My sunburns took over two weeks to heal.

Rajdeep is a mad man. He has nearly killed me 5 times while driving to
locations, especially an all day trip to LA where I nearly prayed for the first
time in my life. In the same way ive seen him nearly fall to his death 3 times
while climbing recklessly, and at the time of writing the man has a broken arm
from flying headfirst over the handelbars of his mountian bike.

The single most pivitol life and family moment was when I presided over my
sisters wedding. Before I migrated to San Diego i was invited to a pary by my
older sister. I arrived on time to a basement apartemnt in east vancouver
entirely filled with strangers. Three hours later when my sister arrived I was
completely lit after having started the night doing boiler makers with
burnouts. My sister asked me if I was going to give a speech at her weeding. I
hopped up onto a chair and delivered a passonate treaste on the nature of
marrage, coupling, and their entwinement to both the holy spirit and it's
manifestation in Kelsey and AJ. I also went on to talk Steven Universe cosplay
for an hour, little did I know I had been voulenterred to run my sisters
wedding cerimony.
</p>

<p>
It was hinted at though conversation and texts that I would run the cerimony,
but never formalized. In optimistic anticipation I planned a speach considering
carefully my word choice with which to join the two families. Two weeks before
my sister offically asked me, I bought a suit, penned a draft of the speech and
flew to Vancouver. The hours prior to the wedding were a "Gong Show" the
ceremony was to be held in AJ's back yard, and no one had planned on the setup
past getting a few benches made. I hauled ass for two days setting up the back
yard in preperation for the practice cerimony. The practice was in fact the
real thing. I don't have the ability to merry people in Canada, so the dress
rehersal formalized thier marrage in Law. I did not get to practice my part,
the true officate walzted in with an air of pure athority, measured the room to
check that no one was being forced into matrimony and presented the papers for
signing. During the cerimony he read from a large leather bound book, which in
my opinion was offical as fuck.
</p>

<p>
On the day of the wedding I co-opeed a large leather photo album from my
parents closet and stuffed it with my notes for the cerimony. Fifteen minutes
before I decided to make key revisions for another punch line right in the
middle. Somehow in the chaos of the cerimony I also became the MC. Quite
nervous I annouced that the cerimony would be starting soon, and lined up with
the groomsmen at the front of the alter. As the music started playing I side
stepped from the groomsmen and extracted my book from the closest makeshift
pew. With perhaps the widest smile I've ever concocted I opened the book and
took my position at the center of the alter. My inlaws and family had been
totally unaware I would be preforming the cerimony so at this moment a huge
look of confusion, and worry passed over the crowd. Kelsey and AJ approached, I
welcomed them, and delivered.
</p>

<p>
To this date it's the second best presentation I've ever given, I got 3 laughs
and 3 sets of tears from the audience. It was a real soul stirring piece to
make the Grandmas happy and get the kids thinking. To my mind the only better
talk I gave was my Masters defense. TODO here is a link to the text I free
wheeled it at the time. The long and short of it is that I have now been dubbed
MC of the family and am expected to run all future weddings and funerals. I
suggest strongy that you try to gain this title as it comes with extreme power
and clout!
</p>

Some of the writing you did, humblebee bumblebee specifcially, and my own
artistic indeveors into mimicing the greats convinced me to take my own writing
more serously. I started a writing club at UCSD with Ariana Murian. Each week
we read a chapter of Joseph M. Williams - Style lessons in clarit and Grace,
and critique the writing of one of the fellow group members. The group is
successfull to the point that all intense gradute students from the sysetms and
networking lab joined. The fearful have shyed away from having their work
criqutied. We are working on being more freindly.
</p>



<p>
I began at the beginning and I'll end at the end. I spend a lot of time at the
climbing gym, training, eating and exercising. The point of the training is to
execute outdoors. My ex-labmate Erin McGinnins is a training machine. She
pushes herself at the regular and rock climbing gym 20-30 hours a week. We
partnered up for the summer. My training dramatically improved and I've seen a
marked improvement both at the gym and outside. From her forceful diet and
regement combined I'm the strongest I've ever been in my life. From a distance
Erin may seem to be a silly, ripped, comedian but under close inspection she is
pure military from precise timing, to her mass consumption of extremely bland
and nutrious food. Having found success in her practices I absorbed them and
now find myself drinking refriedurated oats and coffee every morning.
