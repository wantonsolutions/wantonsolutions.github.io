<h2 id="recreation">Recreation</h2>

<p>
The life of a PhD student is mainly study, but the high energy healthy people
that the masochistic job attracts leads to adventurous activities. My lab mates
with adventure in their bones include Audry, Raj, Erin, MJ, and Anil. All
members of this list I convinced to haul their asses up rock walls, and in turn
got me to commit to fun and strange activities in turn. My rock climbing
adventures are the most numerous, and too wide to recount all in a letter
without becoming boring. However I will pen some of my exploits and the
people I've done them with.
</p>

<p>

Multi-pitch climbing is when you climb more than one pitch of a rock wall, a
pitch being a 30-45m section.  When you complete the first your belay partner
follows up the leader and you continue climbing. This is how you climb sheer
mountain faces thousands of feet high. Before coming to San Diego I had never
multi pitch climbed before. My lab mate Audrey Randell, a red headed distance
runner with a hair trigger personality and scary cutting marks on her forearm,
suggested that we go climb Mt El Cajon after learning that I was a strong
climber. Audrey pulled up to my house 5:00am that Sunday morning with red
Subaru (named Tubaru). On the way to the route I got chewed out for not waiting
outside and asking what Reddit was. After a 30min drive and 45min uphill hike
to the base of the crag I realized I could not find my belay device, a critical
piece of climbing gear, which as it happens had fallen from my bag. We decided
not to do the route as rational humans since dropping our only other belay
device would mean hours stranded on the wall. Instead we tried a few single
pitches, during which time we devised a way to pass our single belay device
back and fourth by swinging it up to 40m between us on a rope and headed up.
For the next 6 hours in the blazing sun my life was at extreme risk as neither
of us knew exactly what to do, and our single most critical piece of safety
gear was quite often hanging from a literal thread. The feeling of fear
climaxed when I nearly fell 80ft down off an outcropping known as Triton tower
situated 400ft above the desert. We ascended the mountain, and passing our
belay device back and fourth lowered each other down the sheer clif. I cried a
little when my feet touched the ground. Audrey lectured me on why Prince Andrew
and Pierre were both bastards and we ate some ice cream afterwards. My sunburns
took over two weeks to heal.

Rajdeep is a mad man. He has nearly killed me 5 times while driving. OF note
was an all day trip to LA where I nearly prayed for the first time in my life.
In the same way I've seen him nearly fall to his death 3 times while climbing
recklessly, and at the time of writing the man has a broken arm from flying
headfirst over the handlebars of his mountain bike. His facebook profile is his
cast acompanieed by his sunglass, and grin adorned face.

The single most pivotal life and family moment was when I presided over my
sisters wedding. Before I migrated to San Diego i was invited to a party by my
older sister. I arrived on time to a basement apartment in east Vancouver
entirely filled with strangers. Three hours later when my sister arrived I was
completely lit after having started the night doing boiler makers with a bunch
of burnouts. My sister asked me if I was going to give a speech at her weeding.
I hopped up onto a chair and delivered a passionate Trieste on the nature of
marriage, coupling, and their commitment to both the holy spirit and it's
manifestation in Kelsey and AJ. I also went on to talk Steven Universe cosplay
for an hour, little did I know I had been volunteered to ajudicate my sisters
wedding ceremony.

</p>

<p>

My role was hinted at though conversation and texts that I would run the
ceremony, but never formalized. In optimistic anticipation I planned a speech
considering carefully my word choice with which to join the two families. Two
weeks before my sister officially asked me, I bought a suit, hammered out a
draft of the text and flew to Vancouver. The hours prior to the wedding were a
"Gong Show" the ceremony was to be held in AJ's back yard, and no one had
planned on the setup past getting a few benches made. I hauled ass for two days
setting up the back yard in preparation for the practice ceremony. The dress
rehersal was in fact the real thing. I don't have the ability to marry people
in Canada, so the pantomime production formalized their marriage in Law. I did
not get to practice my part, the true officiate waltzed in with an air of pure
authority, measured the room to check that no one was being forced into
matrimony and presented the papers for signing. During the ceremony he read
from a large leather bound book, which in my opinion was official as fuck.

</p>

<p>
On the day of the wedding I co-oped a large leather photo album from my
parents closet and stuffed it with my notes for the ceremony. Fifteen minutes
before I decided to make key revisions for another punch line right in the
middle. Somehow in the chaos of the ceremony I also became the MC. Quite
nervous I announced that the ceremony would be starting soon, and lined up with
the groomsmen at the front of the alter. As the music started playing I side
stepped from the groomsmen and extracted my book from the closest makeshift
pew. With perhaps the widest smile I've ever drawn I opened the book and
took my position at the center of the alter. My in laws and family had been
totally unaware I would be preforming the ceremony so at this moment a huge
look of confusion, and worry passed over the crowd. Kelsey and AJ approached, I
welcomed them, and delivered.
</p>

<p> 

To this date it's the second best presentation I've ever given, I got 3 laughs
and 3 sets of tears from the audience. It was a real soul stirring piece to
make the Grandmas happy and get the kids thinking. To my mind the only better
talk I gave was my Masters defense. TODO here is a link to the text I ad libed
some of the performance. The long and short of it is that I have now been
dubbed MC of the family and am expected to run all future weddings and
funerals. I suggest strongly that you try to gain this title as it comes with
extreme power and clout!

Some of the writing you did, humblebee bumblebee specifically, and my own
artistic endeavors into mimicking the greats convinced me to take my own writing
more seriously. I started a writing club at UCSD with Ariana Marian. Each week
we read a chapter of Joseph M. Williams - Style lessons in clarity and Grace,
and critique the writing of one of the fellow group members. The group is
successful to the point that all intense graduate students from the systems and
networking lab joined. The fearful have shied away from having their work
critiqued. We are working on being more friendly.

<p>

I began at the beginning and I'll end at the end. I spend a lot of time at the
climbing gym, training, eating and exercising. The point of the training is to
execute outdoors. My ex-labmate Erin McGinnins is a training machine. She
pushes herself at the 24 Hour Fitness and rock climbing gym 20-30 hours a week.
We partnered up for the summer. My training dramatically improved and I've seen
a marked gains in both the gym and on the rocks. From her forceful diet and
regiment combined I'm the strongest I've ever been in my life. From a distance
Erin may seem to be a silly, ripped, comedian but under close inspection she is
pure military from precise timing, to her mass consumption of extremely bland
and nutritious food. Having found success in her practices I absorbed them and
now find myself drinking refrigerated oats and coffee every morning.
