</p>

<p>
Hand written letters are keepsakes, but websites are accessable. In a time when
we could just facebook I strugged to think of how I could still use a digital
medium alongside an analog one.

California is composed of a variety of beautiful and hazardous biomes. San
Diego and Los Angeles are part of a special and rare biome known as the
chaparral. It’s a dry and dusty climate with occasional intense humidity blown
in from the ocean which makes a thick fog on most fall mornings. Every hillside
is covered in shrubs, cacti and non-native palm trees. I crashed my bike while
enjoying a ride in the fog and among the trees, I thrown over the handlebars
and skidded along the pavement in slick sandals until I hit an embankment and
went tumbling into a shrub. This was my most intimate engagement with the
chaparral to date (my bike remains unfixed [photo of bike]). San Diego is the
most diverse biome in the united states, in addition to the Chaparral it is
composed of the Pacific Ocean, San Diego river basin, and multiple desserts. 
</p>

<p> 
In one of my long FB posts I mentioned the Anzaberego dessert. It’s a harsh
place but full of life, I went there to witness the superbloom, an intense
botanical explosion in the desert. I wore my Neo Yokio Caprese Martini shirt on
the trip, it did not protect my shins from the cacti. I recreated the scene
from No Country for Old Men with Anton Sugar in the bathroom performing self
surgery on the car ride home. It was worth it, if you find yourself out in the
Californias you would be remiss to not visit the dessert.
</p>

<p> 
Many of my exploits over the past year involve rock climbing, and the people I
went with. Joshua Tree is a magical garden hidden out at altitude in the
desert.   Sand swept  granite  rises out of the desert, twisting and swooping
into all kinds of strange and unique shapes. The contours and crakes on hard,
gritty granite make for a climbers paradise. I went with three lab mates Erin
McGinnin, Audrey Randall, and Rajdeep Das, each a character in their own right.
Together we struggled up the notoriously difficult J-Tree boulders. I shredded
myself on classic dubbed “Pig Fucker”, a flaking and powerful mantel onto an
overhanging crack. For my success Audrey made me a figurine [picture of pig].
Yabo roof nearly dislocated my shoulder. We all got blown raw by granite in the
wind, Raj dropped Erin on her ass with no pad, and Erin kicked me in the head
on the car ride home.
</p>

<p> 
The day before Joshua Tree I climbed in New Jack City, a dusty craig in the
desert filled with snakes and beatniks. I climbed sketchy routes which tested
my will on the slick granite. Erin nearly died disconnecting her rope from the
belay loops while setting an anchor. Raj almost pulled me to serious injury by
not knowing his gear, and Audry climbed the hardest route out of all of us and
nearly degloved her finger by pulling on a bolt. The rock features of New Jack
are jagged and slick granite. These features are typified by the areas premiere
route Crooked Dick which was too busy to climb. Two climbing bums in their late
40’s Bill, and Ted cheered our team on while drinking beers at 9am and talking
about the good old days. Bill picked up a 10 pound gopher snake and attempted
to make every man woman and child touch the friendly beast before putting back
to it’s home. Our crew was joined by two more UCSD students Daniel (a stern
outdoorsman), and MJ ( a hilarious homosexual). Together the 6 of us did acro
yoga and only sustained minor injuries. I managed to base Erin for a side star
tick tock without killing her, an achievement for my usually taut hamstrings.

Mt. San Jacinto State Park is accessible via the united states highest rotating
tram. The tram rises out of Palm Springs over near vertical precipes while
spinning and blasting hits from the 50’s to the 90's including Staying Alive
and I believe in a thing called love. Mt. San Jacinto (Tramway) is the cool,
due to altitude, summer rock climbing roost for southern California. The park
was filled with critters, chipmunks, squirrels, coyotes, and unseen bears. My
team was Tammy (a heart surgeon), Erin (a colleague), and Ken (a lovable
pervert). Ken, the most experienced climber,  guided us through tramway park
exposing us to some of it’s best climbing. A personable man, Ken chatted with
every group we met,  he suggested subtle and useful beta, bummed a beer, asked
to swap shoes with people, and insisted for five minutes that it was a
gentleman's duty to carry tampons in the wilderness to a group of seven women
we bumped into. Ken also caught my head during a fall, and I still climb with
this enigma of the man to this  day. Tramway in the evening is a beautiful
place, slowly descending into the sweltering desert from the mountain tops and
watching the sun disappear over the crest of the valley is stunning. On the
three hour drive home Tammy gave me the best directions I’ve ever been given.

If there is anything that marks me thus far it's my work. Without a nod to the
predominat expendeture of my time on earth a personal letter would be
incomplete.

I needed to take classes again to satify my PhD requirements. My lab mates had
a syncronized schedule so I hopped on and registerd with them. The first
research project I embarked on was fun but a farce. For an embedded systems
class I pitched the idea that farming could be automated if only we could solve
the problem of harveting rype plants. For the sake of loose assosiation to
pedagogy and satan I studied apples. Specifically if their rypeness could be
detected automatically with the use of a camera and WiFi. The answer is a
resounding no. 500 photographs of Royal Galla apples, a manilla tag studio, and
an impressive image processing data set told me that apples, after picking,
take months do develop signes of decay. Furthr they decompose at astoundingly
different rates, and variations based on some known factors, like the farm of
origin, and some still unkown to me.

Alex Snoeren is my advisor now. He makes Ivan look like a laxidosal slob in
terms of academic precision. I prepare my language for 30 min before every
meeting with him, and prepare for a barrage of questions at even the most
slight out of place nuance on the charts I produce. It's a fantastic game and
I'm a throughly better researcher than when my tenure at UBC expired.
</p>

<p>
I had the most fortunate of encounters. Maxwell Bland is a masters graduate of
UCSD, he talks in riddles, paints his shoes, and acts like a child in the most
abnoxcious of ways. He combines lazer like focus with a shallow understanding
of computer science at large while simultanously providing insight at a level
some assistant professors could only dream of. In some ways I acted as mentor
to Max as his advisor was largly awol. We chatted and argued about philosopy,
literature, music and memes. My favourte string to pull was mentioning DFW and
watch him explode into a tangent about the fall of socieoty due to post-modern
thought, and the stategies upon which we could save ourselves from nihilism. I
found myself paired with max for a Networking group project in a class last3L00
Fall taught my advisor. I had suggestd that we look into programmable
networking for a class project and considered using some of the hardware in the
lab.
</p>

<p>
3pm Wednesday Max burst into my lab, sweat dripping down between his middle
parted hair. "Stew, this is important I need you now". We walked out of the
lab, down around the corner, to another proffessors office, and I was sat down
without explaination. "This is Stew, another researching of programmable
networking" Max decleared. I was about a quarter second from retreating back
into myself in the face of real researchers in the feild, but Fortuna got the
better of me and I decided to fully bullshit for a full hour abour research I
knew very little about. Sitting across from me was a Cavium executive, and a
professor whose name I still don't know. I pretened I understood programmable
networking, and within an hour I was back in my lab. Within two weeks we had
been gifted two bleeding edge programmble NIC's worth around 10K. I started a
research project around the NIC"s, Max although enthusiastic about staring the
project, never contributed a line of code to the repo.
</p>

<p>
It's been six months since that fateful day. I've proposed a novel operating
system for isloating tennatns on light weight programmalbe networking devices.
I have two members of the lab working with me on it and we will likely publishri
to a major conference within a year. Max graduated with his masters degree and
disapered to UICU. I chat with him occasionally, he sends me art and music.
ItPGQwould have been fun to push the research further with him, but he's really
securiy anyways. His antics are missed in the lab, it seems like just yesterday
he wore a shirt promoting a tijuana strip club to an event organized largely by
the GRADWICS society, or that we argued about the best death grips albums, or
the subltly of transgresive 19th century Frech nighilist erotica.

<p>
The life of a PhD student is mainly study, but the high enery healthy people
that the masochistic job attracts leads to adventours activities. My lab mates
with adventure in their bones incude Audry, Raj, Erin, MJ, and Anil. Allrisk
members of this list I convinced to haul their asses up rock walls, and in turn
got me to commit to fun and strange activities in turn. My rock climbing
adventures are the most numerous, and too wide to recount all in a letter
without becoming boring. However I will recount some of my adventures and the
people I've done them with.
</p>

Multi-pitch climing is when you climb more than one pitch, a pitch is 30-45m,
when you complete the first your belay partner follows up the leader and you
continue climbing. This is how you climb sheer mountian faces thousands of feet
high. Before comming to San Diego I had never multi pitch climbed before. My
lab mate Audrey Randel, a red headed distance runner with a hair trigger
personality and scary cutting marks on her forearm, suggested that we go climb
Mt El Cajon after learning that I was a strong climber. Audrey pulled up to my
house 5:00am that Sunday morning with red Subaru. On the way to the route I got
chewed out for not waiting outside and asking what Reddit was. After a 30min
drive and 45min uphill hike to the base of the craig I realized I could not
find my belay device, a critical piece of climbing gear, which as it happens
had fallen from my bag. We decided not to do the route as rational humans,
tried a few single pitches, devised a way to pass our single belay devince back
and fourth by swining it up to 40m between us on a rope and headed up. For the
next 3 hours my life was at extreme risk as neither of us knew exactly what to
do, and our single most critical piece of saftly gear was quite often haning
from a literal thread. The feeling of fear climaxed when I nearly to a 80ft
fall off an outcropping known as triton tower at 400ft. We ascended the
mountian, and passing our belay device back and fourth lowered eachother down
the mountain. I cried a little when my feet touched the ground. Audrey lectured
me on why Prince Andrew and Pierre were both bastards and we ate some icecream
afterwards. My sunburns took over two weeks to heal.
</p>

Rajdeep is a mad man. He has nearly killed me 5 times while driving to
locations, especially an all day trip to LA where I nearly prayed for the first
time in my life. In the same way ive seen him nearly fall to his death 3 times
while climbing recklessly, and at the time of writing the man has a broken arm
from flying headfirst over the handelbars of his mountian bike.
</p>

<p>
The single most pivitol life and family moment was when I presided over my
sisters wedding. Before I migrated to San Diego i was invited to a pary by my
older sister. I arrived on time to a basement apartemnt in east vancouver
entirely filled with strangers. Three hours later when my sister arrived I was
completely lit after having started the night doing boiler makers with
burnouts. My sister asked me if I was going to give a speech at her weeding. I
hopped up onto a chair and delivered a passonate treaste on the nature of
marrage, coupling, and their entwinement to both the holy spirit and it's
manifestation in Kelsey and AJ. I also went on to talk Steven Universe cosplay
for an hour, little did I know I had been voulenterred to run my sisters
wedding cerimony.
</p>

<p>
It was hinted at though conversation and texts that I would run the cerimony,
but never formalized. In optimistic anticipation I planned a speach considering
carefully my word choice with which to join the two families. Two weeks before
my sister offically asked me, I bought a suit, penned a draft of the speech and
flew to Vancouver. The hours prior to the wedding were a "Gong Show" the
ceremony was to be held in AJ's back yard, and no one had planned on the setup
past getting a few benches made. I hauled ass for two days setting up the back
yard in preperation for the practice cerimony. The practice was in fact the
real thing. I don't have the ability to merry people in Canada, so the dress
rehersal formalized thier marrage in Law. I did not get to practice my part,
the true officate walzted in with an air of pure athority, measured the room to
check that no one was being forced into matrimony and presented the papers for
signing. During the cerimony he read from a large leather bound book, which in
my opinion was offical as fuck.
</p>

<p>
On the day of the wedding I co-opeed a large leather photo album from my
parents closet and stuffed it with my notes for the cerimony. Fifteen minutes
before I decided to make key revisions for another punch line right in the
middle. Somehow in the chaos of the cerimony I also became the MC. Quite
nervous I annouced that the cerimony would be starting soon, and lined up with
the groomsmen at the front of the alter. As the music started playing I side
stepped from the groomsmen and extracted my book from the closest makeshift
pew. With perhaps the widest smile I've ever concocted I opened the book and
took my position at the center of the alter. My inlaws and family had been
totally unaware I would be preforming the cerimony so at this moment a huge
look of confusion, and worry passed over the crowd. Kelsey and AJ approached, I
welcomed them, and delivered.
</p>

<p>
To this date it's the second best presentation I've ever given, I got 3 laughs
and 3 sets of tears from the audience. It was a real soul stirring piece to
make the Grandmas happy and get the kids thinking. To my mind the only better
talk I gave was my Masters defense. TODO here is a link to the text I free
wheeled it at the time. The long and short of it is that I have now been dubbed
MC of the family and am expected to run all future weddings and funerals. I
suggest strongy that you try to gain this title as it comes with extreme power
and clout!
</p>

<p>
Some of the writing you did, humblebee bumblebee specifcially, and my own
artistic indeveors into mimicing the greats convinced me to take my own writing
more serously. I started a writing club at UCSD with Ariana Murian. Each week
we read a chapter of Joseph M. Williams - Style lessons in clarit and Grace,
and critique the writing of one of the fellow group members. The group is
successfull to the point that all intense gradute students from the sysetms and
networking lab joined. The fearful have shyed away from having their work
criqutied. We are working on being more freindly.
</p>



<p>
I began at the beginning and I'll end at the end. I spend a lot of time at the
climbing gym, training, eating and exercising. The point of the training is to
execute outdoors. My ex-labmate Erin McGinnins is a training machine. She
pushes herself at the regular and rock climbing gym 20-30 hours a week. We
partnered up for the summer. My training dramatically improved and I've seen a
marked improvement both at the gym and outside. From her forceful diet and
regement combined I'm the strongest I've ever been in my life. From a distance
Erin may seem to be a silly, ripped, comedian but under close inspection she is
pure military from precise timing, to her mass consumption of extremely bland
and nutrious food. Having found success in her practices I absorbed them and
now find myself drinking refriedurated oats and coffee every morning.
