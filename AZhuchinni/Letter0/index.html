<p>
Hand written letters are keepsakes, but websites are accessable. In a time when
we could just facebook I strugged to think of how I could still use a digital
medium alongside an analog one.

California is composed of a variety of beautiful and hazardous biomes. San
Diego and Los Angeles are part of a special and rare biome known as the
chaparral. It’s a dry and dusty climate with occasional intense humidity blown
in from the ocean which makes a thick fog on most fall mornings. Every hillside
is covered in shrubs, cacti and non-native palm trees. I crashed my bike while
enjoying a ride in the fog and among the trees, I thrown over the handlebars
and skidded along the pavement in slick sandals until I hit an embankment and
went tumbling into a shrub. This was my most intimate engagement with the
chaparral to date (my bike remains unfixed [photo of bike]). San Diego is the
most diverse biome in the united states, in addition to the Chaparral it is
composed of the Pacific Ocean, San Diego river basin, and multiple desserts.

In one of my long FB posts I mentioned the Anzaberego dessert. It’s a harsh
place but full of life, I went there to witness the superbloom, an intense
botanical explosion in the desert. I wore my Neo Yokio Caprese Martini shirt on
the trip, it did not protect my shins from the cacti. I recreated the scene
from No Country for Old Men with Anton Sugar in the bathroom performing self
surgery on the car ride home. It was worth it, if you find yourself out in the
Californias you would be remiss to not visit the dessert.

Many of my exploits over the past year involve rock climbing, and the people I
went with. Joshua Tree is a magical garden hidden out at altitude in the
desert.   Sand swept  granite  rises out of the desert, twisting and swooping
into all kinds of strange and unique shapes. The contours and crakes on hard,
gritty granite make for a climbers paradise. I went with three lab mates Erin
McGinnin, Audrey Randall, and Rajdeep Das, each a character in their own right.
Together we struggled up the notoriously difficult J-Tree boulders. I shredded
myself on classic dubbed “Pig Fucker”, a flaking and powerful mantel onto an
overhanging crack. For my success Audrey made me a figurine [picture of pig].
Yabo roof nearly dislocated my shoulder. We all got blown raw by granite in the
wind, Raj dropped Erin on her ass with no pad, and Erin kicked me in the head
on the car ride home.
</p>

<p> 
The day before Joshua Tree I climbed in New Jack City, a dusty craig in the
desert filled with snakes and beatniks. I climbed sketchy routes which tested
my will on the slick granite. Erin nearly died disconnecting her rope from the
belay loops while setting an anchor. Raj almost pulled me to serious injury by
not knowing his gear, and Audry climbed the hardest route out of all of us and
nearly degloved her finger by pulling on a bolt. The rock features of New Jack
are jagged and slick granite. These features are typified by the areas premiere
route Crooked Dick which was too busy to climb. Two climbing bums in their late
40’s Bill, and Ted cheered our team on while drinking beers at 9am and talking
about the good old days. Bill picked up a 10 pound gopher snake and attempted
to make every man woman and child touch the friendly beast before putting back
to it’s home. Our crew was joined by two more UCSD students Daniel (a stern
outdoorsman), and MJ ( a hilarious homosexual). Together the 6 of us did acro
yoga and only sustained minor injuries. I managed to base Erin for a side star
tick tock without killing her, an achievement for my usually taut hamstrings.

Mt. San Jacinto State Park is accessible via the united states highest rotating
tram. The tram rises out of Palm Springs over near vertical precipes while
spinning and blasting hits from the 50’s to the 90's including Staying Alive
and I believe in a thing called love. Mt. San Jacinto (Tramway) is the cool,
due to altitude, summer rock climbing roost for southern California. The park
was filled with critters, chipmunks, squirrels, coyotes, and unseen bears. My
team was Tammy (a heart surgeon), Erin (a colleague), and Ken (a lovable
pervert). Ken, the most experienced climber,  guided us through tramway park
exposing us to some of it’s best climbing. A personable man, Ken chatted with
every group we met,  he suggested subtle and useful beta, bummed a beer, asked
to swap shoes with people, and insisted for five minutes that it was a
gentleman's duty to carry tampons in the wilderness to a group of seven women
we bumped into. Ken also caught my head during a fall, and I still climb with
this enigma of the man to this  day. Tramway in the evening is a beautiful
place, slowly descending into the sweltering desert from the mountain tops and
watching the sun disappear over the crest of the valley is stunning. On the
three hour drive home Tammy gave me the best directions I’ve ever been given.

If there is anything that marks me thus far it's my work. Without a nod to the
predominat expendeture of my time on earth a personal letter would be
incomplete.

I needed to take classes again to satify my PhD requirements. My lab mates had
a syncronized schedule so I hopped on and registerd with them. The first
research project I embarked on was fun but a farce. For an embedded systems
class I pitched the idea that farming could be automated if only we could solve
the problem of harveting rype plants. For the sake of loose assosiation to
pedagogy and satan I studied apples. Specifically if their rypeness could be
detected automatically with the use of a camera and WiFi. The answer is a
resounding no. 500 photographs of Royal Galla apples, a manilla tag studio, and
an impressive image processing data set told me that apples, after picking,
take months do develop signes of decay. Furthr they decompose at astoundingly
different rates, and variations based on some known factors, like the farm of
origin, and some still unkown to me.

Alex Snoeren is my advisor now. He makes Ivan look like a laxidosal slob in
terms of academic precision. I prepare my language for 30 min before every
meeting with him, and prepare for a barrage of questions at even the most
slight out of place nuance on the charts I produce. It's a fantastic game and
I'm a throughly better researcher than when my tenure at UBC expired.
</p>

I had the most fortunate of encounters. Maxwell Bland is a masters graduate of
UCSD, he talks in riddles, paints his shoes, and acts like a child in the most
abnoxcious of ways. He combines lazer like focus with a shallow understanding
of computer science at large while simultanously providing insight at a level
some assistant professors could only dream of. In some ways I acted as mentor
to Max as his advisor was largly awol. We chatted and argued about philosopy,
literature, music and memes. My favourte string to pull was mentioning DFW and
watch him explode into a tangent about the fall of socieoty due to post-modern
thought, and the stategies upon which we could save ourselves from nihilism. I
found myself paired with max for a Networking group project in a class last3L00
Fall taught my advisor. I had suggestd that we look into programmable
networking for a class project and considered using some of the hardware in the
lab.
</p>

<p>
3pm Wednesday Max burst into my lab, sweat dripping down between his middle
parted hair. "Stew, this is important I need you now". We walked out of the
lab, down around the corner, to another proffessors office, and I was sat down
without explaination. "This is Stew, another researching of programmable
networking" Max decleared. I was about a quarter second from retreating back
into myself in the face of real researchers in the feild, but Fortuna got the
better of me and I decided to fully bullshit for a full hour abour research I
knew very little about. Sitting across from me was a Cavium executive, and a
professor whose name I still don't know. I pretened I understood programmable
networking, and within an hour I was back in my lab. Within two weeks we had
been gifted two bleeding edge programmble NIC's worth around 10K. I started a
research project around the NIC"s, Max although enthusiastic about staring the
project, never contributed a line of code to the repo.

<p>
It's been six months since that fateful day. I've proposed a novel operating
system for isloating tennatns on light weight programmalbe networking devices.
I have two members of the lab working with me on it and we will likely publish
to a major conference within a year. Max graduated with his masters degree and
disapered to UICU. I chat with him occasionally, he sends me art and music.
ItPGQwould have been fun to push the research further with him, but he's really
securiy anyways. His antics are missed in the lab, it seems like just yesterday
he wore a shirt promoting a tijuana strip club to an event organized largely by
the GRADWICS society, or that we argued about the best death grips albums, or
the subltly of transgresive 19th century Frech nighilist erotica.
