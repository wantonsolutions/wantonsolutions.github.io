I found myself in the middle of a love triange, or rather a love box, with one
very ambitious point. Erin and I had a thing for eachother since our first day
out on the rocks (and I had become enamered after witnessing her onsight of a
5.11+ offwidth); Audrey, with her hair trigger personality long distance
boyfreind aperently also has a thing forlled unkept celts. The former situation
I was well acuainted with, the latter did not manifest itself untill I
suggested we all go out for a drink after a day at the craig. At the worst dive
bar in Clairmont we played foozeball, pool and darts, Erin a teatoddler stayed
dry, I enjoyed some american burbon, and Audrey quickly drank over her limit.
Erin, disgusted with our lubrisious behavior called a lift for the three of us
and we decided to all crash at Audreys's because it was 2am and the closest.
This turned out to be a near fatal mistake as it resulted in a final visit from
Dr. Jack Daniels. Audrey in an intoxicated tour de force demanded to know why
Erin and I were not together due to "Being Perfect", then demanded background
details from me resulting in a sloppy fifteen minute dissertation on how nine
year relationships don't end marrage, followed by a full confession from Audrey
a bewildered shutdown from me, intesne eye contanct around the room, an hour of
sleep, an escape by Erin and I, "and 7 hours sweating out whiskey on the lab
couch Sunday. Monday was " awkward. Two weeks later Audrey left for Google,she's
back in October, we still chat, at least 4 years left of PhD with her desk
directly across from mine.

<p> An Idea about digging a large hole on the beach circulated the office in
early May. It was joked about at lunch, some of us googled the geography of San
Diego to determine where bed rock was, others investigated the price of boring
machines, and some the depth and placement of electrical lines. When pressed
though none were willing to commit to the occasion. Erin, who after finishing
her masters degree was only killing time till job at Amazon in Seattle started
entertained the idea fully. Some Saturday in late May after the two of us had
fourtfive minute bus trip, and four hour climbing and workout session, I
decided to throw down the gauntlet and ask "So are we digging the hole today?".
We regrouped at her place to prepare. As an introduction to sparta I was
offered paain rice, with pressure cooked chickpeas and raw sliced carrots
topped with olive oil and sprinked with ionized salt. We found two plastic
trowels and a childs sand castel bucket with a sille nozzel protrouding from
the bottom.  We missed our 8:00pm buss and hiked to the beach under Scripps
pier. In feverish anticipation we eyeballed eachother, the sand, the buckets,
trowels and then without cerimony began. For two and a half hours we dug
shoulder to shoulder with hand an trowel covered in sand and muck. The hole was
grand, with a 2.5 foot radius and at least four feet of depth. When we hit
water we retired our shovels for refreshments and devoured disgustingly
squished banandas covered in sandy grit iniitiating an even sandier and more
disgusting embrace. "Do you feel secure?" follwed by a tell-tale cackle rang
through the night air as I was crushed like the vitem of a boa constrictor. In
the sand and under the stars we decided to conquor the rocks of southern
california and make the most of the summer. We exited the hole and trugged
tired and filthy back to UTC. At her place she called me a cab and within a
minute it pulled up. In that moment my heart knew that the pureest course of
action was to say "I have a question to ask you... Are you single?" then get in
the cab and leave. Just as I was about to let another summer end in two blue
barely touching boats she kicked me in the head from behind, so I turned around
so I asked for a kiss intead.  </p>
