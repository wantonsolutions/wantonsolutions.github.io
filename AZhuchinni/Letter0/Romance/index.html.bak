To entice another letter I'll supply some Jucice.
</p>

<p>

I found myself in the middle of a love triange, or rather an open love square,
with one very ambitious point. Erin and I had a thing for eachother since our
first day out on the rocks (and I had become enamered after witnessing her
onsight of a 5.11+ offwidth); Audrey, with her hair trigger personality long
distance boyfreind aperently also has a thing forlled unkept celts. The former
situation I was well acuainted with, the latter did not manifest itself untill
I suggested we all go out for a drink after a day at the craig. At the worst
dive bar in Clairmont we played foozeball, pool and darts, Erin a teatoddler
stayed dry, I enjoyed some american burbon, and Audrey quickly drank over her
limit.  Erin, disgusted with our lubrisious behavior called a lift for the
three of us and we decided to all crash at Audreys's because it was 2am and the
closest.  This turned out to be a near fatal mistake as it resulted in a final
visit from Dr. Jack Daniels. Audrey in an intoxicated tour de force demanded to
know why Erin and I were not together due to "Being Perfect", then demanded
background details from me resulting in a sloppy fifteen minute dissertation on
how nine year relationships don't end marrage, followed by a full confession
from Audrey a bewildered shutdown from me, intesne eye contanct around the
room, an hour of sleep, an escape by Erin and I, "and 7 hours sweating out
whiskey on the lab couch Sunday. Monday was " awkward. Two weeks later Audrey
left for Google,she's back in October, we still chat, at least 4 years left of
PhD with her desk directly across from mine.  </p>

<p> An Idea about digging a large hole on the beach circulated the office in
early May. It was joked about at lunch, some of us googled the geography of San
Diego to determine where bed rock was, others investigated the price of boring
machines, and some the depth and placement of electrical lines. When pressed
though none were willing to commit to the occasion. Erin, who after finishing
her masters degree was only killing time till job at Amazon in Seattle started
entertained the idea fully. Some Saturday in late May after the two of us had
fourtfive minute bus trip, and four hour climbing and workout session, I
decided to throw down the gauntlet and ask "So are we digging the hole today?".
We regrouped at her place to prepare. As an introduction to sparta I was
offered paain rice, with pressure cooked chickpeas and raw sliced carrots

topped with olive oil and sprinked with ionized salt. We found two plastic
trowels and a childs sand castel bucket with a sille nozzel protrouding from
the bottom.  We missed our 8:00pm buss and hiked to the beach under Scripps
pier. In feverish anticipation we eyeballed eachother, the sand, the buckets,
trowels and then without cerimony began. For two and a half hours we dug
shoulder to shoulder with hand an trowel covered in sand and muck. The hole was
grand, with a 2.5 foot radius and at least four feet of depth. When we hit
water we retired our shovels for refreshments and devoured disgustingly
squished banandas covered in sandy grit iniitiating an even sandier and more
disgusting embrace. "Do you feel secure?" follwed by a tell-tale cackle rang
through the night air as I was crushed like the vitem of a boa constrictor. In
the sand and under the stars we decided to conquor the rocks of southern
california and make the most of the summer. We exited the hole and trugged
tired and filthy back to UTC. At her place she called me a cab and within a
minute it pulled up. In that moment my heart knew that the pureest course of
action was to say "I have a question to ask you... Are you single?" then get in
the cab and leave. Just as I was about to let another summer end in two blue
barely touching boats she kicked me in the head from behind, so I turned around
so I asked for a kiss intead.

At this point to keep any reader interested a profile is probably nessisary.
McGinnis was a complete misnomer for a one hundred percent Roman Italian,
rather than kin these people treated my ancestors like wild animals. The first
thing I noticed was her razor wit which she eployed to lampoon everything
around her. Any conversation probing deeper than her comedic exterior is likely
to ricochet off the 40cm thick psycolocial military grade steel forming her
mind. Rarely have I met someone so resolute in their convictions and whom then
refected them in their actions. Outside of her (accurate) work hours,
agendizing of travel, and mountious of reading is an exercise and stretching
schedule that would put an olympian to shame. Hopefully this helps to paint a
picutre of a 5"3' wild haired muscle stack of a contorionist. These traits
manifested themselves as an outrageously independent, opinionated, and highly
motivated individual. 


</p>


<p>
As a fellow highly independent person we barely collied from the beginning,
myself contained to the lab, and those I needed to interact with, and her using
open spaces and attening only forced group social events. It occured to me
during our time together that highly independent opinionated people rarely
date, the two of us combined had been single for over nine years. The comedy of
it is that such pairings are not only easier due to the absensce of baggage,
but intrinsiclly mutually benifical as people who are entirely self sufficint
can simply choose for recreation the aspects of their lives and chorese with
which they want to entrust to another person.
</p>


<p>

Perhaps the most entertaining about the collision of independents are the
aspects of conflict which arrise from the way we have learned to survive on our
owns. While these were numerous between the two which were the most
entertaining were food and regiment. To support her mass, Erin eats many
containers of food daily, due to lacking time, and an extensive history of
lacking money her diet was spartan beyond belief. Cold plain oatmeal for
breakfasy, cold rice, pressure cooked beans, carrots and salt for lunch and
dinner. In perhaps one of my greatest efforts of will I tried to convince this
women that with a few tricks basic cooking techniques simple recipies could be
made delicious. This required tooth and nail argumentation for the addition of
bannanas, and yoghurt to oatmeal, and avid demonstration of the benifits of
salt and cooking order for beans and rice. After a few days of barren
breakfasts and dinners I elicted to cook everything as a demonstration. My time
as a personal chef was well spent, and I definatly fushed out my repotorie of
high protien vegitarian meals cookable in less than half an hour. In sixty days
using tom sawyer fench painting tatictics of enticement I was able to shoehorn
a few spices into her recipe book, and a second pan onto the cooktop. In
juxtiposition my laxidozal approach to showing up to lab, fixing broken
electronics, and exercise slowly desigend an anurism for erin. Hundrends of
texts of the form, "buy a new phone", "call to get a car battery", "use the
warenty to fix your laptop" "stretch after exercise" lined my inbox. Actuating
these mundane tasks became a meditative hobby for me, and by the end of the
summer most of my affairs with the exception of international car imports were
largely handeled.

</p>

<p>

And now for a point of intrigue: this entire affair is secret. Post hole
digging and ommiting gorey details we discussed ourselves and determined that
our lab mates were better in the dark. This decision was twofold first to guard
ourselves from eachother, and second we preemtivly decided to break it off in
August after she moved to Washington for Amazon. Our secrecy was made all the
more intense by the fact we worked at the same conjoined desk after moving to
the same lab, and organized multiple out of lab events with coworkers. Thus
began a summer of deciet. In lab we acted entirely normal, complete shitheads,
and flew under the radar. However, as a disclaimer the lead to more moments of
intense cross room eye contact and sublte tandem lies than a small town boy
like myself ever expected out of life. The whole engagement was rather exciting
and added a lot of entertainment to the day. Typically mundane activities like
comming and going from an office are reinvigored when you plan staggering times
to prevent your collegues from notcing that you live with one of them five days
a week.

</p>

<p>

The comedy of our deceitful romance rolled forward through the summer. We
played it cool openly while simultanously generating the most deplorable and
degerate slack chat imaginable. I organized meals, local outings to interesting
local, and events (watching the sun set on the pacific while siting on torries
pines with food and music is as enjoyable as it is steriotypical), and she put
together ridged training regements and teams of climbers for outdoor
adventures. This is a single letter and every detail is available upon request
so I'll summarize that we: toured southern California, learned the history,
art, geography, flora, and fauna; read books, screend cartoons, commented on
climing; wrote, critiqued, taste tested, botched cuisine, and watched the clock
slowly tick down.

</p>

<p> 

"Everything with wings is restless" (JN) -- At the black core of independence
and ambition is the isolation that comes from repeatedly moving on alone.
Before we knew it the bell was tolling. With a bit of fan fare we made the most
of our final week, and then prepared for the move. I had elected to help the
move by driving her and all her things (8 boxes and a few apliances) to
Washington. The foreboding drive was a high energy and comedic jaunt to the
north. We dammaged a chair at a super 8, ate fallafas and visited Erin's
"soulmate" (a 15 year best freind named Alexa in Porland. Alexas was the
highlight of the trip, he house was filled with good company, a corocopy of
food from around the state, and wonderous creatres. I petted a parrot with no
feathers, got teabaged all night by a hairless cat jeepers, and was licked
awake by a glorious golden retreiver. We were wished the best and sent north
with an air mattress.

</p>

<p>

The final leg was anxious bliss. The move was was a breeze and I installed Erin
with room mate, and into her locaton without sweat.  We broke our ridged
exercies and diets to enjoy the nicieties of Seattle, and discarded our quarter
long bar of public affection. The final day in Seattle was packed with
unpacking, installing, and viewing of blown glass installations. The next day
was final and around pike place, the gum wall and the stroll to the amtrack bus
station there was a sense of doom in the atmosphere. The thirty minutes wait
for the bus was an awkward and emotional affair. Watching the clock tick toward
departure seemed like more of a whisper than a bang so I decided to re-enact a
gross perverison of the final scene from Princess Mononoke's opening act. 

</p>

<p>
"Hey Erin, do you want a keep sake?"
</p>
<p>
"You mean like a lock of hair? Sure"
</p>

<p>
I dug into my bag for a pair of purple scisciors I'd packet for the occasion,
pulled them up, lifted them to the back of my neck and with a *Snip cut off my
hook necklace. A cry of "NOOOO", and explosion of tears, and a laughing fit when
she pulled a pink squishy grip strengh trainer from her bag in a desperate
attempt to produce an equivalent token. In a snot nosed separation we said
goodbye. I suppose you can draw blood from a stone.
