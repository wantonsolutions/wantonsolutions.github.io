My living conditions and lack of finance has stunted my pallets growth. While
you would probably expect that California, being the garden of Eden that it,
would produce a huge variant of produce you'd be wrong. The average Vancouver
Safeway is stocked similarly in California, and the specialty stores have
(along with increased prices) only a few additional vegetables. With this
stated some interesting cuisine has crossed my lips, mostly specific to
California.

</p>


<p>

First and foremost is the Mexican diner, and my mainstay  - the vegetable
burrito.  Mexican cuisine is a different animal down near the border, similar
to the direct import of every Chinese culture to Richmond, every conceivable
Mexican delecicy is represented. Typically they are divided into land foods: beef,
pork, chicken and sea foods: fish, shrimp, and shellfish. Some just serve
Tequila to tourists.

The part of the Mexican diner which is the most critical is the salsa bar. At a
very minimum there will be three sauces. The first a red tomato based mild
sauce, the second a medium green tomatillo sauce, and the final a hot pepper
based sauce. In a good salsa bar there will be at least 6 different salsas, the
traditional inclusions are thick yogurt based sauces, vinegars, and blended
veggies. The salsa delivery system is my favorite. The accepted method is to take a
bite of a burrito, use your teeth to create a small indentation in the center,
then pour a generous helping of a salsa into the hole to be completely consumed
upon the next bite. Rinse and repeat.

</p>


<p>
The best of the salsa bars have pools of pickled vegetables as well. This is
the most interesting variance across locations, and the one which in my opinion
determines the highest quality restraints. Carrots are typical, followed by
peppers. I've seen places experiment with radish, dill, and even mushroom. I
once hopped on the train right down to the border and walked around the slummy
parts of San Diego by Imperial Beach. In a tin roofed hole in the wall I found
pickled prickly pear beside the peppers.  It was the sharpest picked flavor
I've ever experienced. The cactus had, like it's desert hardened biology saw
fit, absorbed everything it was emerged in. Nothing has ever been more pickle
than that prickly pear. But, it was not crisp, if I try any experimental
pickling in the coming months it will be to pickle cactus and make it ultra
crisp with desert salt.

On the return of a climbing trip I had the most amazing Turkish coffee. The
flavor was doubly enhanced by the $1 price tag. It was the last item on the
menu of a small family run Turkish kebab shop. When I ordered the matriarch
asked if I was Turkish, I'll take it as a complement. She went into the back
and asked her husband and son if they wanted any coffee, then proceeded to make
3. If you are unfamiliar with Turkish coffee, the beans are ultra finely
ground, and heated in sand. The coffee is cooked by incrementally adding the
water and moving the mixture in the sand until the boiling coffee nearly
overflows. In the end you are given a tiny cup of ultra strong soupy coffee
that becomes a bitter lunch if you sip too far down. I would describe it like
drinking the sweet and bitter ectoplasim of a ghost busters ghoul trapped in
purgatory for the sin of eating raw coffee beans.

Little has happened in the way of alcohol, except that I drink less now. I've
explored breweries from all over San Diego, but few are inspired. Mostly they
are the same, or worse than the breweries I have toured in Vancouver. No one in
my lab really drinks whiskey. The two who did graduated. The others behave...
poorly... while intoxicated. Perhaps when I get my own studio apartment I will
collect some more whiskeys and enjoy some aggressive nightcaps over research
papers. I have however at the time of writing (Sept 23 2019) just visited
Chicago and Madison Wisconsin for Amanda Carbonari birthday. In Madison there
is a wonderful olive old and whiskey shop called "Castle and Doyle". They give
free samples of Whiskey and tell interesting stories while introducing them. I
had a 19yo Scottish Highland ultra peaty dram that smelled like a used kilt.
