My living conditions and lack of finance has stunted my palets growth. While
you would probably expect that California, being the garden of eaden that it 
would produce a huge variant of produce you'd be wrong. The average vancouver
safeway is stocked similarly in california, and the specialty stores have
(along with increaed prices) only a few additional vegtables. With this stated
some interesting cuisine has crossed my lips, mostly specific to California.
</p>


<p>

First and formost is the mexican diner, and the vegtiable burrito, my mainstay.
The Mexican diner is a different animal down near the border, simialr to the
direct import of every chineese cuiseine to Richmond, every conceiveable
mexican food is represented. Typically they are devided into land foods: beef,
pork, chicken and sea foods - fish, shrimp, and shellfish. Some just serve
Tequela to tourists.

The part of the mexican diner which is the most critical is the salsa bar. At a
very minimum there will be three sauces. The first a red tomato based mild
sauce, the second a medium green tomatillo sauce, and the final a hot pepper
based sauce. In a good salsa bar there will be at least 6 different salsas, the
traditional inclusions are thick yhoughert based sauces, vigars, and blended
veggies. The delivery sysetm is my favourite, the accepted method is to take a
bite of a burrito, use your teeth to create a small intentation in the center,
then pour a generous helping of a salsa into the hole to be completely consumed
upon the next bite. Rinse and repeat.

The best of the salsa bars have pools of pickeled vegtables as well. This is
the most interesting variance across locations, and the one which in my opinion
determines the highest quality restarunts. Typical is carrorts, followed by
peppers. I've seen places experiment with raddish, dill, and even mushroom. I
once hopped on the train right down to the border and walked around the slummy
parts of San Diego by Imperial Beach. In a tin roofed hole in the wall I found
pickeled prickely pear beside the peppers.  It was the sharpest picked flavor
I've ever experienced. The cactus had, like it's desert hardened biology saw
fit, absorbed eveything it was emersed in. Nothing has ever been more pickel
than that prickely pear. But, it was not crisp, if I try any experimental
pickeling in the comming months it will be to pickel cactus and make it ultra
crisp.

On the return of a climbing trip I had the most amazing turkish coffee. The
flavor was doubly enhanced by the $1 price tag. It was the last item on the
menu of a small family run turkish kebab shop. When I orderd the wife asked if
I was turkish, I'll take it as a complement. She went into the back and asked
her husband and son if they wanted any coffee, then proceeded to make 3. If you
are unfamilar with turkish coffee, the beans are ultra finely ground, and
heated in sand. The coffee is cooked by incrementally added the water and
moving the mixture in the sand untill the boiling coffee nearly overflows. In
the end you are givend a tiny cup of ultra strong soupy coffee that becomes a
bitter lunch if you sip too far down. I would describe it like drinking the
sweet and bitter ectoplasim of a ghost busters ghoul trapped in purgatory for
the sin of eating raw coffee beans.

Little has happend in the way of alcohol, except that I drink less now. I've
explored brewaries from all over San Dieo, but few are inspired. Mostly they
are the same, or worse than the brewaries I have toured in vancouver. No one in
my lab really drinks whiskey. The two who did graduated. The others behave...
poorly... while intoxicated. Perhaps when I get my own studio apartment I will
collect some more wiskeyes and enjoy some tasteful nightcaps over research
papers. I have however at the time of writing (Sept 23 2019) just visited
Chiago and Madison wisconson for Amanda Carbanaris birthday. In Madison there
is a wonderful olive old and whiskey shop called "Castel and Doyle". They give
free samples of Whiskey and tell interesting stories while introducing them. I
had a 19yo Scottish Highland ultra peaty dram that smelled like a used kilt.
