If there is anything that marks my daily experience now, it's my work. Without a
nod to the predominate expenditure of my mental time on earth a personal letter
would be incomplete.

I needed to take classes again to satisfy my PhD requirements. For fun I
synchronized my classes with my lab mates as an excuse to get to know them
better. The first research project I embarked on was a complete farce. For an
embedded systems class I pitched the idea that farming could be automated if
only we could solve the problem of harvesting perfectly ripe plants. I chose to
study apples because of their loose association to pedagogy and Satan.
Specifically if their ripeness could be detected automatically with the use of
a camera and WiFi. The answer is a resounding no. 1025 photographs of Royal
Gala apples, a manila tag studio, and an impressive image processing data set
told me that apples, after picking, take months to develop signs of decay.
Further they decompose at astoundingly different rates, and variations based on
some known factors, like the farm of origin, and some still unknown to me. I
presented this work to laughter and applause in front of the entire faculty and
staff of our systems and networking group.

Alex Snoeren is my advisor now. He makes Ivan look like a laxidosal slob in
terms of academic precision. I prepare my spoken language for 30 min before
every meeting with him. I find myself studing my own charts for minutes teasing
out the meaning behind every small reation in anticipation of an avalance of
questions about even the slightest suspicious nuance.  It's a fantastic game
and I'm a thoroughly better researcher than when my tenure at UBC expired.

Maxwell Bland is a masters graduate of UCSD. He talks in riddles, paints his
shoes, and acts like a child in the most obnoxious of ways. He combines laser
like focus with a shallow understanding of computer science at large while
simultaneously providing insight at a level some assistant professors could only
dream of. In some ways I acted as mentor to Max as his advisor was largely AWOL.
We chatted and argued about philosophy, literature, music and memes. My favorite
string to pull was mentioning David Foster Wallace and watch him explode into a
tangent about the fall of society due to post-modern thought, and the
strategies upon which we could save ourselves from nihilism. I found myself
paired with Max for a networking group project in a class last fall taught my
advisor. I had suggested that we look into programmable networking for a class
project and considered using some of the hardware in the lab.

3pm Wednesday Max burst into my lab, sweat dripping down between his middle
parted hair. "Stew, this is important I need you now". We walked out of the
lab, down around the corner, to an unknown professors office, and I was sat down
without explanation. "This is Stew, another researching of programmable
networking" Max declared. I was about a quarter second from retreating back
into myself in the face of real researchers in the field, but Fortuna got the
better of me and I decided to fully bullshit for a full hour about research I
knew very little about. Sitting across from me was a Cavium executive, and a
professor whose name I still don't know. I pretended I understood programmable
networking, and within an hour I was back in my lab. Within two weeks we had
been gifted two bleeding edge programmable NIC's worth around 10K. I started a
research project around the NICs, Max although enthusiastic about staring the
project, never contributed a single line of code to the repo.

It's been six months since that fateful day. I've proposed and implemented a
novel operating system for isolating tenants on light weight programmable
networking devices.  I have two members of the lab working with me on it and we
will likely published to a major conference within a year. Max graduated with
his masters degree and disappeared to UIUC. I chat with him occasionally, he
sends me art and music.  It would have been fun to push the research further
with him, but he is a hacker at heart and will only ever do security. His
antics are missed in the lab, it seems like just yesterday he wore a shirt
promoting a Tijuana strip club to an event organized largely by the GRADWIC
society, or that we argued about the best death grips albums, or the subtly of
transgressive 19th century French nihilist erotica.  </p>
