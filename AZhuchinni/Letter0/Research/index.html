If there is anything that marks me thus far it's my work. Without a nod to the
predominat expendeture of my time on earth a personal letter would be
incomplete.

I needed to take classes again to satify my PhD requirements. My lab mates had
a syncronized schedule so I hopped on and registerd with them. The first
research project I embarked on was fun but a farce. For an embedded systems
class I pitched the idea that farming could be automated if only we could solve
the problem of harveting rype plants. For the sake of loose assosiation to
pedagogy and satan I studied apples. Specifically if their rypeness could be
detected automatically with the use of a camera and WiFi. The answer is a
resounding no. 500 photographs of Royal Galla apples, a manilla tag studio, and
an impressive image processing data set told me that apples, after picking,
take months do develop signes of decay. Furthr they decompose at astoundingly
different rates, and variations based on some known factors, like the farm of
origin, and some still unkown to me.

Alex Snoeren is my advisor now. He makes Ivan look like a laxidosal slob in
terms of academic precision. I prepare my language for 30 min before every
meeting with him, and prepare for a barrage of questions at even the most
slight out of place nuance on the charts I produce. It's a fantastic game and
I'm a throughly better researcher than when my tenure at UBC expired.

I had the most fortunate of encounters. Maxwell Bland is a masters graduate of
UCSD, he talks in riddles, paints his shoes, and acts like a child in the most
abnoxcious of ways. He combines lazer like focus with a shallow understanding
of computer science at large while simultanously providing insight at a level
some assistant professors could only dream of. In some ways I acted as mentor
to Max as his advisor was largly awol. We chatted and argued about philosopy,
literature, music and memes. My favourte string to pull was mentioning DFW and
watch him explode into a tangent about the fall of socieoty due to post-modern
thought, and the stategies upon which we could save ourselves from nihilism. I
found myself paired with max for a Networking group project in a class last3L00
Fall taught my advisor. I had suggestd that we look into programmable
networking for a class project and considered using some of the hardware in the
lab.

<p>
3pm Wednesday Max burst into my lab, sweat dripping down between his middle
parted hair. "Stew, this is important I need you now". We walked out of the
lab, down around the corner, to another proffessors office, and I was sat down
without explaination. "This is Stew, another researching of programmable
networking" Max decleared. I was about a quarter second from retreating back
into myself in the face of real researchers in the feild, but Fortuna got the
better of me and I decided to fully bullshit for a full hour abour research I
knew very little about. Sitting across from me was a Cavium executive, and a
professor whose name I still don't know. I pretened I understood programmable
networking, and within an hour I was back in my lab. Within two weeks we had
been gifted two bleeding edge programmble NIC's worth around 10K. I started a
research project around the NIC"s, Max although enthusiastic about staring the
project, never contributed a line of code to the repo.

It's been six months since that fateful day. I've proposed a novel operating
system for isloating tennatns on light weight programmalbe networking devices.
I have two members of the lab working with me on it and we will likely publishri
to a major conference within a year. Max graduated with his masters degree and
disapered to UICU. I chat with him occasionally, he sends me art and music.
ItPGQwould have been fun to push the research further with him, but he's really
securiy anyways. His antics are missed in the lab, it seems like just yesterday
he wore a shirt promoting a tijuana strip club to an event organized largely by
the GRADWICS society, or that we argued about the best death grips albums, or
the subltly of transgresive 19th century Frech nighilist erotica.
