	<p>
		There are lots of different kinds of hummingbirds. The most common in San
		Diego are Anna's hummingbirds. That's what your going to see at these
		feeders. Check out the chart and see if you can spot other varieties. The
		females are harder to spot than the males. Their faces are just a bit less
		bright.

	<h2> Why is there a humming bird cafeteria outside of Mesa Neueva's Cresta
	Apartments?</h2> 
		<p> Hummingbirds are just so beautiful and energetic I could not resist.
		Seriously just take a look at these delightful little buzzing buggers for thirty
		seconds and see if you don't have a smile on your face. I build the cafeteria
		because I wanted a show while I cooked dinner, and I thought, hey in for a penny
		in for a pound, let's buy six humming bird feeders ten ports round. Humming
		birds are amazing pollinators and their population is directly tied to the
		success of many plant species.  Typically hummingbirds only raise a single
		chick, however when food is plenty they are known to raise two or three. There
		are hundreds of hummingbirds in the valleys that run just north of Mesa Neueva,
		and down by the I-5. Their food gets short when it gets hot, and these years are
		hotter than ever. 
		<br>
		<br>
		<b>TLDR:</b> I like looking at hummingbirds and want to support the
		local population.</p>

	<h2> What is this bamboo eyesore shaped like a Patriarchal Cross</h2>
		<p> It's not a religious effigy, or at least it's not intended to be one. I
		needed cheap building supplies so I hunted down some invasivly growing bamboo
		down on the <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/8bppv1aH7QjkRo1C8" target="_blank">secret path to Sorento Valley</a>. I was inspired by an <a
		href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTejJnrzGPM" target="_blank">amazing video</a> of Liziqi
		building furniture out of bamboo. My skill is far less, but the home made
		aesthetic remains the same. The design was a <a href="images/feeder.png" target="_blank">matter of debate</a>, if you think you
		have a better one hit me up.<br>

	<h2> I came to look at hummingbirds but there is a strange man behind the
	window weirding me out!</h2>
		<p> Yes I live in this apartment that's the way it goes. Feel free to watch and
		take pictures of the birds, I'm glad for people to do it. Heck if you have any
		questions holler in and I'll probably come out and say hi. My name is Stew btw
		feel free to drop me a line at the link below.</p>

	<h2>Community</h2>
		<p>One of my hopes is to increase the sense of community at Mesa Nueva. I
		believe that public installations, even those as modest as the humming bird
		cafeteria can help to build a sense of local identity. My intuition is that
		people feel a sense of belonging when they participate, so I'd like to encourage
		that here by showcasing some of the ways individuals have engaged with the
		cafeteria.</p>
