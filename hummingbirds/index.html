<h1 id="HummingBirdImage"><img src="anna.jpg" alt="" title="Hummingbird Chart" />Welcome to the Humming Bird Cafeteria</h1>

<br>
<p>

	There are lots of different kinds of humming birds. The most common in San
	Diego are Anna's humming birds. That's what your going to see at these
	feeders. Check out the chart and see if you can spot other varieties. The
	females are harder to spot than the males. Their faces are just a bit less
	bright.

<h2> Why is there a humming bird cafeteria outside of Mesa Neueva's Cresta
Apartments?</h2> 

<p> Humming birds are just so beautiful and energetic I could not resist.
Seriously just take a look at these delightful little buzzing buggers for thirty
seconds and see if you don't have a smile on your face. I build the cafeteria
because I wanted a show while I cooked dinner, and I thought, hey in for a penny
in for a pound, let's buy six humming bird feeders ten ports round. Humming
birds are amazing pollinators and their population is directly tied to the
success of many plant species.  Typically humming birds only raise a single
chick, however when food is plenty they are known to raise two or three. There
are hundreds of humming birds in the valleys that run just north of Mesa Neueva,
and down by the I-5. Their food gets short when it gets hot, and these years are
hotter than ever. 
<br>
<br>
<b>TLDR:</b> I like looking at hummingbirds and want to support the
local population.</p>


<h2> What is this bamboo eyesore shaped like a Patriarchal Cross</h2>

<p> It's not a religious effigy, or at least it's not intended to be one. I
needed cheap building supplies so I hunted down some invasivly growing bamboo
down on the <a href=https://goo.gl/maps/8bppv1aH7QjkRo1C8>secret path to Sorento
Valley</a>. I was inspired by an <a
href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTejJnrzGPM>amazing video</a> of Liziqi
building furniture out of bamboo. My skill is far less, but the home made
aesthetic remains the same. The design was a <a href=feeder.png>matter of debate</a>, if you think you
have a better one hit me up. Here is how it was made:

<h2> I came to look at humming birds but there is a strange man behind the
window weirding me out!</h2>

<p> Yes I live in this apartment that's the way it goes. Feel free to watch and
take pictures of the birds, I'm glad for people to do it. Heck if you have any
questions holler in and I'll probably come out and say hi. My name is Stew btw
feel free to drop me a line at the link below.</p>


<h2>Community</h2>

<p>One of my hopes is to increase the sense of community at Mesa Nueva. I
believe that public installations, even those as modest as the humming bird
cafeteria can help to build a sense of local identity. My intuition is that
people feel a sense of belonging when they participate, so I'd like to encourage
that here by showcasing some of the ways individuals have engaged with the
cafeteria.</p>
