<br>
<p>

	There are lots of different kinds of humming birds. The most common in San
	Diego are Anna's humming birds. That's what your going to see at these
	feeders. Check out the chart and see if you can spot other varieties. The
	females are harder to spot than the males. Their faces are just a bit less
	bright.
