<h2>Prologue</h2>

<p>Two children were born star crossed into houses of meager means. Both were
raised with love -- an awkward knock-kneed love of circumstance and squalor that
bumps and bruises the psyche despite it's gentleness. Their minds, keen and
clever, made them the pride and terror of their parents. They met for the first
time in strollers on the streets outside their town, neither would come to
remember this. In four more years  their minds finally greeted each other on the
second day of kindergarten. Blocks, then talks, some bulling, and some chalk.
They jockeyed for position and eventually the others attention. They chose to
collaboration over obliteration. The pairs friendship through adolescence
crashed violently into their puberty. Stolen wine, secluded pines, a hot mess,
and a loving caress, welded together with a rarefied love which most are too
unlucky to acquire.  Passion and playfulness punctuated their pre-teens, both
found work outside of school, and one another outside of daylight. All seemed
bright; small bubbles of luck emerged from the stew of their youth as they
clamored and fought to outgrow their lot in life. "Wait and see" says the wise
man to any turn of luck -- their sharp minds, tongue and motes of success caught
the jealous eye of some small sad local sods. "I'm sure he thinks he's so much
better than us, and his little bitch too" wined the pathetic wallflowers of life
that lined their town. "I bet we could take him down a peg at the dance after
the harvest fair". The thugs made good in their plot, and as fools do got caught
in the emotion of their acts. A prank to push our protagonist off a pier turned
perilous. First plummeting, then impalement, and a long slow silent sink to the
sand below.  She witnessed half soaked, hidden in the reeds, his body stiffen,
then sink limp, all promise lost in the black hole bath of cold water and bitter
acts.  Her heart broke as his stopped and she uttered a curse on the brutes.
"May hell find you in your lives so long as I can will it". Nature, shaken awake
by the force of the spell felt bemused and perverse after it's long sleep.  In a
moment of queer behavior it reached out and caught the boys soul before it left
his body.</p>

<h2>1</h2>

<p>A knock at the window.</p>

<p>Am I hearing things now she thought. It didn't happen again. Reaching down
beside her bed she missed her target of nights half finished Heineken and
clumsily smeared three fingers into her ash bowl. Fuck, if it wasn't enough that
her will was failing every little fault was an injury of emotion. The miss was
enough to give up on the drink for at least five minutes. Sliding onto her back
without dragging her hand on the sheets she let out a sigh at the ceiling.
"Fuck Everyone", it echoed in the smallest way off the walls. She thought about
how thin how thin the walls were and the lack of insulation. It was like a drum
pulled tight with rawhide begging to bleed reverberated sound. She heard her
mother roll over in the room next door and felt a shot of guilt. Exhaling deeply
she retreated back in, saying the words didn't help and she didn't want to hurt
anyone. Sometimes the lines between embarrassment, shame and pain, felt thinner
than her walls. She was aware enough to know her depression belonged where it
was, feeling anything less would trivialize the last few months, but she was
getting board with herself and bored with her sadness. Another deep exhale
crossed her lips.  Her diaphragm contracted and the air pushed, slowly, across
her lips, wicking little bits of moisture into the air, they wisped around
invisibly, rising away from her into the air of her room, swirling and mixing
with the sealed in atmosphere, phasing in and out of vapor, wafting it's way
deliberately towards the window. On the pane it cooled, condensates, then
collected. collected, just a drop. Suddenly, with a wild motion so foreign to
physical constraints that god herself would have blushed, the drop of watered,
un-dropped, jumping horizontally outward like confused rain, somehow unconcerned
with how gravity thought it should act it reversed itself in a beautiful pattern
of concentric ripples and fell back towards the glass.</p>

<p>A knock at the window.</p>

<p>This time it deserved a look. First though... another hunt for her beer, this
time the motivation to roll onto her belly found her and she lifted the bottle
to her eye level glared with predator like focus at her kill. Mostly bottom
beer.  Mother milk she thought, and slaughtered the last of it before creaking
upwards shakily on the ice cold floor. She tried not to glance in the mirror on
the way to the window but falling victim to habit caught a glimpse. Pain.
Dropping all her sports might have been an error, though soccer just felt like
kicking a ball around now. That sort of thinking was just insult to injury.
That piece of glass was going in the garbage before noon. Approaching the window
she saw the droplet puddling midway up the pane. Odd, is water supposed to do
that, she glanced back at the beer bottles and the ashed weed then back at the
disobedient water.  Methinks somethings wrong about you. She poked her finger
into the water half expecting it to disappear like a mirage in the glass.
Instead it crawled upon her, slithering weakly up her finger. Her
parasympathetic nervous system fired, a few months of abuse did little to temper
a vigours youthful fight or flight response. SNAP! she whipped her wrist sending
every molecule of H20 hurdling back at the single pane glass.</p>

<p>A knock at the window.</p>

<p>Hahaha holy fucking shit what kind of cursed bullshit was that, she giggled and
slowly calmed herself down. She sat back and swallowed hard questioning the
validity of her experience. If it were to happen again she thought it would make
my insanity a little less likely. I'm not sure this is the best phenomenon to
interpret straight though. She took some delectate steps back to the edge of her
bed and with the care of a new mother cleaning a newborn packed herself a fresh
bowl. At least its the weekend. It would be hard to excuse herself of the
indulgence before playing hooky. She mused over her pipe without taking her eyes
off the water, it was shimmering, but did that mean it was still moving. With a
healthy cough she moved back to the window, looking outside this time at her
disheveled front yard.  Fuck, well at least it's not just me not pulling my
weight lately. She remembered how the two of them had organized the front yard
just to make the point that they could. She kneeled down leveled her green, and
now reddening eye close to the water. Maybe it was just some kind of fungal
slime. Her cleaning schedule had been really off track late- and it again
decided to jump. This time directly into her right eye.</p>

<p>A knock at her mind.</p>

<p>Most of the water on planet earth has been there a long time, sometimes it
changes state, sometimes it binds to other chemicals, but for the most part
every drop of water drank has a history as old as the earth. She became aware of
this acutely as the water told her it's history. Rainfall, tumbling down a
river, chilling in a lake, inside a fish, outside a fish, back up in the
atmosphere, down again, in the ocean, in a glade, by a pier, in a mouth, her
lovers mouth, her lovers lungs, a cough, and back again, a final breath, then
resting in her lovers breast. She fell on her ass, mouth open eyes erupting in
tears her mind torn between the safety of her room, and the horror of her lovers
asphyxiation. The tears flushed the water from her eye and it ran down along her
body with a disturbing familiar sensuality. What the fuck is happening she
sobbed. The mixture of weed and the occult was really starting to freak her the
fuck out. The mixture of horror, shock, and arousal fed a torrent of invasive
thoughts. Scrambling and spitting she gingerly sprung from the ground and
crashed into her bed. </p>

<p>A bang against the wall.</p>

<p>Is everything alright Sweety? if you need anything you know I can get it for
you. Thanks mom I'm good just... just... just... masturbating in here, you know
really lonely and all... "Okay dear" she heard stammering thorough the wall. No
more weed, no more booze, and no more fucking acid. Next things next I'm either
getting clean or calling a god damn exorcist. But, in a small flash realization
a suspicion began to grow within her. It's not real though. I thought the worst
part of the grief was over... It might really be a hallucination. She stared
back a the now larger puddle by the wall.  Fuck me, what was that, it felt like
him. The room around her started to fall away like how the walls of a theater
become unnoticeable as a movie starts.  Her toes curled nervously in her sticky
cotton sheets. Sweet jesus this is not fun.  wiggling her toes out of the sheets
she slid back off the bed again and down onto the floor. This time she reached
for her makeshift chemistry glasses from her closet. Imitation Ray Bans from the
flea market with tape on the sides for extra protection against lateral
splashes. The tinted shades made the water hard to see, a slight relief, she
crept back towards it. Was it moving? It was so hard to tell in the dim light.
She got close it looked like it was smearing out, perhaps just working its way
into the grooves of the unfinished wood floor.  Ahh, it was impossible to make
out it's shape with the glasses on. She slowly peered over the top of the
lenses. The water looked like it has squiggled itself along the floor, but the
shape was hard to make out. Light from the window was hitting it from the
outside and she moved her head so that the reflection caught her eye.
Glistening like jewels embedded in the wood the water etched out a glitter text:
"I still love you".</p>

<p>A knock in her chest.</p>

<h2>2</h2>

<p>The human spirit lives inside flesh. It's anchored in blood, and bone, and
tissue. Carbon, Potassium, Nitrogen, Oxygen, Sulfur, water. The basic building
blocks are not so different from an anchor of flesh. The soul of an unfinished
life, with enough huzpuzah, could skate along the bridges of the elements until
it's purpose on earth had completed. It's not that often though, maybe once a
decade. </p>

<p>Out in the garden an errant water droplet had collected on the stem of a rose,
it lumbered down to the soil, smooshing itself into the dirt. Rolling down into
the root system the water had some dirty thoughts about the rose and decided to
climb inside, osmosing itself through the cell walls of the roots and embodying
the stem. My goodness how liberating how free and how fiendish. Like a punk rock
icon beautiful and covered in spikes. Lewd and promiscuous with genitalia on
full display offering pollination to all who try. 30m away a solemn love note
shifted in front of a crying young woman to "Your ass is still perfect". Yuck, a
snap back to reality. Enough malaise, horror and lust for one morning she
thought. But it had to be him, but would he write that. She thought back to some
of the more scandalous text in the letters she still had stashed in her bedside
table. Yea he probably would. Why now though, she bit at her lip staring at the
provocative statement on her bedroom floor. Pensively, and again without losing
eye contact with the floor she reached to the side of her bed for her pipe and
lifting it to her lips inhaled deeply on her still cherried bowel. "Who are you"
she said aloud. The shimmering puddle began to twist and combine. A rose wilted
outside.  The pool wiggled and wormed it way into the words "Drink Me".</p>

<p>Fuck it, in for a penny, in for a pound she thought. She tipped herself down at
the waist towards the water on her hands and knees causing her makeshift goggles
slip off and splash the flirty "A" to pieces. She started slurping the M right
off the wood.  The water happily deformed to chase down the M and join the
party.  She slurped the water down like a noodle, and then picking up her
goggles licked the last bits of her ethereal lover off the lenses.  Sitting down
she considered the insanity of her actions. Was this true madness visiting her?
Perhaps it was a grief ridden episode, were these shocked images in her mind
trauma, was this indulgence in these visions a schizophrenic fantasy?  Before
resolving her existential quandary the water, now metabolizing with it's own
will, absorbed into her organs, and with a clever little trick that only the
smartest little molecule can muster, breached her blood brain barrier and
dropping her backward onto her bed and directly down the rabbit hole.</p>

<p>Three men, or were they boys, too blood-soaked and wretched to tell, writhed,
empaled on spikes, still alive, their final moments pulsing the highest possible
agony she could think of. It had been a dream, she had wanted it, but now she
could see it, she could smell it, and the hellscape she had imagined as their
rightful prison fully surrounded her.</p>

<p>A garggled plea for mercy. </p>

<p>An icy voice inside her whispered no. Clenching fists, and darting eyes the boys
writhed on the spikes protruding through their collars. She walked around them
rhythmically brushing her hand across their destroyed body's moving in the
interlocking circles of demons maypole dance. "Thank you for wanting this" a
voice that was not quite hers said using her mouth. "But you have to let them
go... For you." And the scene vanished. She was alone on a sunny day, not alone,
she was accompanied by a shadow missing a body sitting beside her on a blanket.
They stared together at the mountains.  They sat on a burm made to raise the
highway above the farmland. It elevated the vehicles and carried them out of
their town. It rumbled gently as the cars and semi trailers passed meters above
them.  They sat on an awkwardly landscaped 10 square foot mowed rectangle. He
had walked out the day before with a pushmower and slashed the patch of hay so
they had room for their blanket. The square wasn't perfect, and the thick
freshly cut wild grass stalks poked their butts through the picnic cloth. It
was perfect, just enough to hide them, and just enough space to eat. Next time
though a thicker blanket would be a good idea.  Their radio played some dingy
indy rock. "This is the first time you told me you loved me". The shadow did not
respond.  Each car and truck was like a heartbeat reminding me I had to leave
this town.  The wind blew north towards the mountains. You know that those boys
deserve it right?! I'm not evil for wanting it, they deserve nothing but pain.
The smell of traffic wafted down. And the shadows from the tall grass waved back
and forth blending with her shadowed lover. The grass bent and bowed, and formed
a crown on her shadows head. The gras bent and waved crissing and crossing
mangling the shape of the crown. She leaned in close and in the shadows saw the
text: "Their pain is our pain".</p>

<p>The screech of a car.</p>

<p>They were in his parents bed. They had just finished for the first time. The
evidence would take some removal. "This was a suboptimal choice" she said and
wrapped her arms around a shadow soaked pillow. It floofed out a feather with a
weezing noise. She giggled and made a farting noise with her mouth. You know
while we are here we could go again. She ran her hand along the pillows seam.
The deforming light darkened around the edges of pillow the fluffly strands of
the down feathers stretched down flat along the sheets. Each little fluff curled
into perfect cursive. "We should have stayed like this forever".</p>

<p>A knock at the door.</p>

<p>She was on stage at the state science fair being awarded first place, and slowly
digesting the phrase college scholarship for the first time. There were so many
ways to clean up oil spills she thought. Why was it no one ever thought to use
something that already sucked for them? There were so many spare woodchips down
at the mill and the chemicals she needed were cheap to buy.  The crowd stared at
her and the blood under her skin felt hot. She saw three faces she hated staring
at her distastefully. A pile of ceder ships at her stall beside her diarama made
the entire gymnasium smell like a forest. Trees pull water from their deepest
roots to their tallest branches. No one seems to understand where they get the
energy to suck so much.  The pile of much shifted from an mess to a message
"You've been known to suck to". She scowled with a glint of self satisfaction.
I just thought of how we could use the trees like a sponge", the spotlight on
the stage left two shadows. </p>

<p>The cheer of a crowd.</p>

<p>A perfect autumn day under a grove of ceders. An ensemble of shadows, moving in
the sunlight. A hole, a stone, a wooden box, and a lifeless body. Too soon said
the stone and a shadow at the center spoke words her emotions never let her hear
hear even in her dreams. A group of moving shadows. Unsaid words. She kneeled
down and touched the stone. Granite is a hard rock, formed deep in magma
chambers and cooled slowly. The best granite is full of beautiful quarts that
shines in ribbons through the mica and xenoliths. A cool stone, an old stone, a
lasting stone, she pulled herself against it and re-examined the inscription
"I'm rock hard". She sneezed coughed and laughed at the same time sending a
chunk of something unintentional onto the tombstone. The shadows didn't notice.
They were watching the box. It was slowly lowering down to rest against the
bottom. A shadow moved towards the hole.</p>

<p>The thud of dirt.</p>

<h2>3</h2>

<p>Memory and new realities shifted away. Her room was still cold, she lay on the
floor, a puddle of water leaked from her mouth. For fucks sake, she spun her
eyes in her head and tried to focus them. That was way, way too intense. The
room was like a carousel and her eyes kept flashing back to her dream? memory?
hallucination?  "Give me a god damn break".. pulling herself back to her bed she
eyed the water now sure she'd lost her mind. "Why would you take me there... The
end of that date was terrible". The water, unperturbed by her lack of
self-certainty slithered first across her foot and then up her wall to a region
of paint illuminated by the light from her window. It twisted it'self into
glinting cursive.</p>

<p>"You can't stay afraid of it". What fucking nerve. She was as afraid of the past
as she was of pain, it was always endurable but why engage? The gall of the
ghost made her want to vomit. "So are you omnipotent, do you think you know
whats best". Flickering the liquid flattened out, perhaps embarred, perhaps
unsure. "No", it scribed "But I've seen you happy, free of vengeance". She felt
around inside herself for the rage. Right where it always was, enormous, black,
heavy, dormant but flickering off shockwave like a star emitting solar flairs.
Was it even possible to remove? Or was it just her now? She placed her hands on
her belly as if it housed her hate and needed support. "It will free me too"
wrote the water. Her eyes narrowed so it's all about you eh? You came to visit
me in my torment and now you want to up and leave huh.  The water drizzled
somehow appearing to cry itself into a new statement". "not like this" She felt
it then, the hate binding her lovers soul to her plane. "But they are still
free, no one believed me that they pushed you, how can you expect me to ignore
everything we would have had, my life died with you, look at this" She awkwardly
floundered her arms around at decapitated room.</p>

<p>"Your pretty when you struggle" stained the  slowly waterlogging wall. "Oh go
fuck yourself" she spat getting flustered yet agin.. This ain't no featherweight hate I'm
hauling around. The grief tattooed our lives to my mind, and revenge will be the
laser to remove it. "I've seen their fate, you've seen it too" smeared the wall.
Their spikes run them through deeper every day. The water logged wall was
becoming less coherent. She exhaled and sat cross legged at the end of her bed.
The water rippled down from the wall and paddled along the floor and up her
body, presenting and ugly, wet and familiar hug. It kind of tickled.</p>

<p>A thought of a future.</p>

<p>How will I move my life forward she mused running her fingers through the puddle
on her torso. Like Joan of Arc she thought staring at the print on her wall.
No... power and righteousness but where was the future in her zeal. Like Christ,
that wanker would probably forgive them outright. A long pause of thought...</p>

<p>Like herself she settled, And the water wiggled. Well perhaps a little bit of
 forgiveness, for your sake. It vibrated lovingly and through it's strange
 display of affection she somehow knew she would overcome her hate. Okay she
 said, for you I will try. She tapped at the surface of the water on her belly.
 I guess this makes me a witch, and she laughed. The water pooled into a big
 letter B. She scowled and schleft it off.  Okay she said aloud we'll work
 through this. Together. But on the next date no funerals. I want the next one
 to include that time at the barn. </p>

<p>A flickering candle</p>
