		I hope that YOU have had a bunch of fun today. The
		plan was to surprise you with a cake and for both
		you and trent to solve the puzzles together.
		Unfortunatly with busy lives not every little thing
		can work out. I hope you had a lot of fun, and I
		know that this next year is going to be great :).
