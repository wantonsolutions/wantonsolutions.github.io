		My god if you've made it here congratulations. It
		was hard enough to make that puzzle, I cant imagine
		actually having to solve it. You're journey south
		begins now! You should be able to complete all but
		the final leg of this blue line birthday train trip
		on (you guessed it) the blue line. I'd buy an all
		day proto pass if I were you, the train will be a
		theme. It runs every 15 min and you should be able
		to take it from near ralphs.
