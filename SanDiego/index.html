<p>
San Diego is a young and interesting City, the purpose of this blog page is to collect information about San Diego and southern california so that I can visit interesting places. Moreover this should be a repository for links to books and to maps where interesting locations may be found.
</p>

<h2 id="format">Reading</h2>
<h3 id="format">Best of California's Missions Mansions and Museums</h3>
<p> 

From the index this book can be judged by it's cover, its a collection of
historic buildings in california. The latter part of the book discribes san
Diego. The summary of San Diego touches on the basic history noted on the
wikipedia page. An interesting point is that prior to mining becoming an
indunstry in San Diego it barely had any development. The key mineral to be
mined was <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borax>borax</a> out in the
desert. This book contains references to Mission San Juan Capistrano, Mission
de Alcala, the Estudillo House, Seeley Stable Museum. A large portion of the
final chapter is dedicated to the museums of Balboa Park.

</p>

<h4> Mission San Juan Capistrano </h4>
<p>
Mission in San Juan just north of ocean side. It was set up by Juniperio Serra
just like Mission Alcala. It was closed after the attack in San Diego where <a
href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luis_Jayme">Luis Jame</a> was killed in
1775. Adding to the history a magnitude 6 earthquate hit in 1812 and killed 40
people whene the roof fell on them.
</p>

<h4> Old Town - McCoy House </h4>

<p>
McCoy house is a historic home built in 1869, propery of James McCoy the
sherif. The house was largely destroyed but reconstructed in 2000. The article
stresses the importance of cattle especially their profitability in the form of
Hide and <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tallow>Tallow</a>
</p>

<h4> Balboa Park - Museum of Art </h4>

<p>
Some interesting points of history: Founded 1915. Opened 1926, Used as a Navy
hospital during WWII and opened again in 1947. New wing 1975, 30M donation
1999 by local husband and wife.
</p>

<h4> Twenty Mule Team Museum </h4>

<p>

Borax museum in the town of Boron, this places gives an overview of the history
of Borax mining in San Diego and how it injected a lot of money into the
economy in the early 1900's.

</p>

<h4> Scotty's Castel - Death Valley Ranch </h4>

<p>

A strange catel in the destert, named after a man who never lived there but was
a vicious con man. The castel was built by Alber Mussey Johnson who had real
money after being swoond by the tall tails of Scotty mid swindle. This place
could be a cool vist if I'm ever in the middle of no where.

<h3 id="format">Southern California's Best Ghost Towns</h3>

<p>

This seems to be a book by a very dedicated author who enjoys traveling around
southern california and visiting ghost towns. Of particular interest are the
maps in the book which are all hand drawn. The book itself is supped to be some
kind reference manual for others who want to explore southern California by
truck and visit many of the abanonded mining towns. Not all abandoned towns are
for mining though, some are relocation camps during WWII and others are
railroad towns. None the less all are abandond.

</p>

<h4> Mazanar </h4>

<p>

A gigantic Japaneese Internment camp out in the desert. Over 10,000 Japaneese
were interend there for three years. This could be an interesting and sad visit
into US war policy.

</p>

<h4> Julian </h4>

<p>

Around Juilain there are a number of small mining towns that cropped up due to
the gold rush. Stonewall, and Warlock mine are promedintly mentioned. Warlock
was in production from 1957 till 1962 untill pilfering and caveins shit it
down.
