In the hopes of finding a relic for a new necklace I'm hunting through the archives of San Diego. This page is simply to document the quest.

I decided to formalize my quest into the history of San Diego after visting the Mission de Alcala. I realized that there is a wealth of history, but very little of it is known to the public. If I want to find a relic, or to improve the narrative of San Diego's history I should be more disiplined. Today I went the the clairmont library to look for history books. I documented my findings.

Today I decided to go to the central library downtown. At this point in writing
I'm on the 9th floor in a section dedicated to San Diego history. Litterally
all of the resources I would ever need are here. In the absense of a necklace
this should be my second home.
