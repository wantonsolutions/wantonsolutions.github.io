<h1>Welcome to Cam Rub Fan club the game (Critter Edition)</h1>

<h1>Instructions</h1>

<h2 id="overview""> Overview</h2>

<h3> Welcome to Cam Rub Fan Club the game! Everyone here is friends but they
still want to win. To win the game you need to get the most points, and points
are gained by collecting gems. The real winner is the one that has the most
fun.</h3>
<hr>

<h2 id="characters"> Characters </h2>

<h3>Cam Rub, Trent, Stew and Winnie, are the characters of the game. It's one
boy and one girl to a team. Boys are grey, and girls are white. Teams get color
tokens with velcro on them. It does not matter who plays with who, except to
have one boy and girl per team because they move differently. At the beginning
of the game boys and girls placed as shown below. Boy are kitty-corner to boys,
and girls are kitty corner to girls. Girls move diagonally like bishops in
chess, and boys move horizontally and vertically. Both move one square per turn.
The way characters move is the most exciting part of the game (it's kind of like
checkers) see that section for the details.<h3>
<hr>

<h2> Insert pictures of the players</h2>

<h2 id="setting_up">Setting up the game</h2>

<h3> First choose a team, either orange or green. Then choose a boy and a girl
character. Put both on the velcro of the team tokens. Place each character as
show on the character map. The next step is to place the first gem. Press space
bar on the display to generate an (almost) random position on the board. This
location is where the gem is placed. Rock paper scissors, or an agreed upon game
of skill determines which player plays first.</h3>
<hr>

<h2 id="playing_turn"> Playing a turn </h2>

<h3> On each turn a player gets to choose one piece to move, if they choose a
girl, it follows the girls movement, if they choose a boy it follows the boys
movement. If a player lands on the current gem they collect it and place it in
their scoring area for the points that it is worth. Once the gem is collected a
new gem location is generated by running the generator. After this, it's the
next players turn.</h3>
<hr>

<h2 id="scoring"> Scoring points</h2>

<h3> Each reigon of the map has different points. Points increase from the
inside of the board outward. The scoring is Blue:1, Green:2, Red: 3. You will
need to be clever when deciding if you want to go for points near the center, if
they are worth your time or not.</h3>
<hr>

<h2 id="movement"> Movement </h2>

<h3> The winner of the game will be decided by how clever their movements are,
this is the most technically challenging part of the game. By default boys move
horizontally or vertically one position and girls move diagonally one position.</h3>

<h3>You can use other plays to boost you move! If your move would have you land
on another character you can use their movement direction. In addition to your
own (kind of like checkers). In the examples below a boy uses a girls movement,
and the other way around.  </h3>

<h3> If you jump on a member of your own team you get to steal a single move
just like you see above. But if you jump on the member of another team you can
take either one, or two of their moves. Its up to you to decide whats best</h3>

bounce around until your hearts content and your strategy is exacted.</h3>
