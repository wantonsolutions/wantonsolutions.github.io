<h1>Welcome to Cam Rub Fan Club The Game</h1>



<h2 id="overview""> Overview</h2>

<div class="instructions"> <h3> Welcome to Cam Rub Fan Club the game. Everyone
here is friends but they still want to win! To win the game collect tokens and
get the most points. Token locations are generated by the "Next Token" generator
on this page. This game is for two players, but feel free to play with more.

</h3>
</div>

<h2 id="characters"> Characters </h2>

<div class="instructions">
<h3>
  
  Cam Rub, Trent, Stew and Winnie, are the protagonists. They are paired
  into teams of two. One boy and one Girl each. Boys and girls think differently
  and in this game they move differently too. 
  
  <br><br> In General boys are lighter and girls are darker colors (but it's
  really their physiques that separate them) Teams get color tokens with velcro
  on them. It does not matter what the teams are, except to have one boy and
  girl per team. (Winnie you can mouse over the characters to see yours). </h3>

<h2 id="setting_up">Setting up the game</h2>

<div class="instructions"> <h3> 

First setup the board. It consists of 4 laminated pieces each with a character
on one corner. Arrange them as shown below so that the numbers increase
clockwise around the edges. Each player also gets a score counter for tracking
their tokens. Put one in front of each player. Determine how many tokens you
want to play with. 11 tokens is standard, feel free to play for less or more.

<br><br>

Next choose a team, either orange or green.  Then choose a boy and a girl for
your roster. If you can't decide who plays which team color, or character decide
by playing a mini game (ex: who can hold their breath the longest). Put both on
the velcro of the team tokens. Place each character on their starting position.
Next generate a token by pressing "r" or clicking the Next
Token button. Place the token on it's color and number. The player to go first
is decided with rock, paper, scisors, or another agreed upon game. Examples:
Truth or Dare, Twister, Spin the bottle, ect.. (winnie more mouseover action :)

<h2 id="playing_turn"> Playing a turn </h2>

<div class="instructions"> <h3> Players alternate turns. On your turn you must
move one character. Characters follow the movement rules detailed below (it's a
bit like chess, and a bit like checkers).  If a player lands on a token they
collect it and put it on their score card for its value. Finally they generate a
new token. </h3> </div>

<h2 id="scoring"> Scoring points</h2>

<div class="instructions">
<h3> The color of the square a token is on determines how many points it's worth.
<br>

<br>Blue:  1
<br>Green: 2
<br>Red:   3
<br><br>

Lower value colors are generated more often. This means the center of the board
is most likely to generate a token. Be strategic about which tokens you collect.


</h3>
</div>

<h2 id="movement"> Movement </h2>

<div class="instructions">
<h3> 

  Girls move diagonally, and Boys move vertically and horizontally. Characters
  move a single unit by default, but they can hopscotch off another character if
  they land on them. Hopscotching off a team member lets you make one additional
  move using the movement direction of the character you landed on.  If a girl
  lands on a boy she can move one square vertically, or one horizontally and
  vice versa. If you land on an opponent you can choose to move either one or
  two square using the same rules as above.  Below are examples of player
  movements.

<center><h2 id="winning"> Winning the Game </h2></center>

<h3> When the final token has been collected the game is over. Each player sums
up their tokens values to get their final score. The winner is the player with
the highest score. This game is played for glory, but optionally the loser can
be forced to do a humiliation.  </h3></div>

<div class="instructions">

<div class="sub_instructions">
<h2> Generating a token </h2>

<h3> When a token is generated it is placed on the board. If a token is
generated onto player, that player gets the points right away and another token
is generated </h3>
</div>


<div class="sub_instructions">
<h2> Return to home </h2>

<h3> To spice things up play the return to home variation. When you hopscotch
off a player you can decide weather to take their move, or to send them home.
When you send a player home they are moved directly to their starting position.
If their starting position has a character on it the player that sent them home
wins the game.
